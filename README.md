# langtools-mcp: Multi-Language Code Analysis Sidecar for Agents & Automation

## Overview

**langtools-mcp** is a modular, multi-language code analysis and static-check sidecar for agents, LLMs, CI/CD, and developer automation.  
It orchestrates best-in-class language tools (like [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff), gopls, rust-analyzer, and more) using a robust daemon architecture.

**Key Features:**

- üîó **Unified API:** One protocol/entrypoint for diverse language toolchains and linters
- üîÑ **Automatic Sidecar Management:** Daemon is launched and cleaned up for you
- ‚õìÔ∏è **Designed for scale:** Supports multi-lang codebases and batch processing
- üîú **Future-Ready:** Easily extend with new language tools

## Architecture

```text
+-------------------------------+      HTTP (localhost)        +-------------------------------+
|     langtools-mcp (MCP)       | <------------------------->  |   langtools_daemon sidecar    |
+-------------------------------+                              +-------------------------------+
                                                                              |
                                                                          (runs linters)
                                                                              v
                                                                ruff, gopls, rust-analyzer, etc.
```

When you launch the main server or CLI, `langtools_daemon` is started automatically and managed as a subprocess.  
All analysis requests‚Äîregardless of the underlying language‚Äîare routed to this sidecar, which coordinates the appropriate language tools.

## Features

- **Multi-language support:** Python (Ruff) ready now; Go, Rust, and others coming soon
- **Decoupled code analysis:** No need for IDEs, editors, or direct dependency on any single tool
- **Headless & batch-friendly:** Perfect for LLMs, CI pipelines, review bots, automation

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOURORG/langtools-mcp.git
cd langtools-mcp
uv sync
```

---

## Quickstart

To process a single file:

```bash
python -m langtools_mcp path/to/your_file.py
```

---

## How It Works

- MCP exposes an `AnalyzeFile` tool and protocol (see `src/langtools_mcp/server.py`) which dispatches analysis requests through a registry to the daemon.
- The daemon routes the request to the appropriate tool and returns normalized results as JSON.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Tool not found error:**  
  Make sure the language tool (e.g. Ruff for Python) is installed via pip/uv/uvx.
- **macOS Gatekeeper:**  
  Only an issue if you install a language tool manually as a system binary; not typical for default usage.

## Roadmap

- Add Go (gopls), Rust (rust-analyzer), TypeScript, etc.
- More advanced batch analysis/LLM feedback features
