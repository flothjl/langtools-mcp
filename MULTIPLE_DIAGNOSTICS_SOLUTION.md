# LSP Multiple Diagnostic Messages Collection - Implementation Summary

## Problem Analysis

The original LSP adapter implementation had a critical flaw in the `gather_notifications` method where it would return immediately after receiving the first non-empty diagnostic message. This caused the loss of subsequent diagnostic messages from language servers like gopls.

### Root Cause

```python
# Original problematic code
if method_filter == "textDocument/publishDiagnostics":
    for r in result:
        params = r.get("params", {})
        if "diagnostics" in params and params["diagnostics"]:
            return [r]  # <-- Only returns first message!
```

### Why This Matters

LSP servers like gopls often send multiple `publishDiagnostics` notifications:
- **Compiler errors**: Syntax and type checking errors
- **Linting issues**: Go vet warnings
- **Code analysis**: Staticcheck and other analyzer warnings
- **Multiple files**: When analyzing dependencies

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Collection Strategy

The improved `gather_notifications` method now uses a "settle" strategy:

```python
def gather_notifications(self, method_filter=None, timeout=10.0):
    """
    Gather notifications from the LSP server.
    
    For diagnostics, this method now collects ALL diagnostic messages rather than
    stopping at the first non-empty one. Uses a "settle" strategy: after receiving
    the first diagnostic message, it waits for additional messages before returning.
    """
    # ... implementation waits 500ms after last diagnostic message
```

### 2. Key Improvements

- **Collect All Messages**: No longer stops at first non-empty diagnostic
- **Settle Period**: Waits 500ms after the last diagnostic message to catch additional ones
- **Timeout Protection**: Falls back to 80% of total timeout to prevent hanging
- **Backwards Compatible**: Non-diagnostic notifications still return immediately

### 3. Enhanced Gopls Adapter

The `GoplsLSPAdapter` now provides richer information:

```python
return {
    "status": "ok", 
    "diagnostics": diags,  # ALL diagnostic messages
    "summary": {
        "total_messages": len(diags),
        "total_diagnostics": total_diagnostics,
        "sources": list(diagnostic_sources)
    }
}
```

## Test Results

### Before (Original Implementation)
- **Messages collected**: 1
- **Diagnostics lost**: Multiple messages from different sources
- **Information**: Limited to first diagnostic batch

### After (Improved Implementation)
- **Messages collected**: ALL available messages (2+ in test cases)
- **Diagnostics captured**: Complete diagnostic information
- **Information**: Rich summary with sources and counts

## Usage Impact

### For API Consumers
```python
# Now returns comprehensive diagnostic data
result = analyzer.analyze("file.go")
print(f"Total messages: {result['summary']['total_messages']}")
print(f"Total diagnostics: {result['summary']['total_diagnostics']}")
print(f"Sources: {result['summary']['sources']}")
```

### For Other Language Servers
The improved implementation will work better with any LSP server that sends multiple diagnostic messages:
- **Python**: pylsp, pyright
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: typescript-language-server
- **Rust**: rust-analyzer
- **C++**: clangd

## Configuration Options

The implementation includes configurable timing:
- **Settle time**: 500ms (can be adjusted)
- **Timeout fallback**: 80% of total timeout
- **Minimum wait**: 100ms between checks

## Future Considerations

1. **Configurable Strategies**: Could add different collection strategies for different language servers
2. **Source-Based Collection**: Could wait for specific expected sources
3. **Performance Optimization**: Could cache frequently analyzed files
4. **Metrics**: Could track collection performance and success rates

## Testing

Comprehensive tests verify:
- Multiple diagnostic message collection
- Timeout behavior
- Settle period functionality
- Backwards compatibility
- Performance characteristics

The implementation successfully addresses the original issue while maintaining performance and compatibility.
