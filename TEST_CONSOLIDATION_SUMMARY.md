# Test File Consolidation Summary

## What We Did

Successfully consolidated `test_lsp_adapter.py` and `test_improved_lsp_adapter.py` into a single, comprehensive test file.

## Key Changes

### 1. Enhanced MockLSPProcess Class
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Supports both old `stdout_lines` format and new `diagnostic_messages` format
- **Legacy Alias**: Added `DummyPopen = MockLSPProcess` for compatibility
- **Flexible Interface**: Can simulate both single and multiple diagnostic messages

### 2. Comprehensive Test Coverage

The new `test_lsp_adapter.py` includes:

1. **test_lspclient_init_and_shutdown**: Basic LSP client lifecycle testing
2. **test_gopls_adapter_batch_diag_legacy**: Legacy compatibility test for empty diagnostics
3. **test_multiple_diagnostic_messages_collection**: New test for multiple diagnostic collection
4. **test_diagnostic_settle_timeout**: Test for settle timeout behavior

### 3. Test Results

- **Before**: 6 tests across 2 files (with some duplication)
- **After**: 4 comprehensive tests in 1 file
- **Coverage**: Maintains all original test coverage plus new multi-message capabilities
- **Performance**: Reduced test execution time by eliminating duplicates

## Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All LSP adapter tests in one place
2. **Better Maintainability**: Less code duplication and easier to update
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests both legacy and new functionality
4. **Backwards Compatibility**: Ensures existing functionality still works

## Files Removed

- `tests/test_lsp_adapter.py` (original)
- `tests/test_improved_lsp_adapter.py` (temporary)

## Files Modified

- `tests/test_lsp_adapter.py` (new comprehensive version)

All tests pass successfully, confirming that the consolidation was successful and no functionality was lost.
